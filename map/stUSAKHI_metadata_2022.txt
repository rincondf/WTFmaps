  Description:
    Abstract:
      The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural
      Statistics Service (NASS) conducted an Agricultural Census in 2022.  The
      statistical census data are summarized at the state, county, and U.S. levels
      and are available in a digital format.  The Research and Development Division
      of NASS modified generalized state boundaries to show geographic areas for
      which the 2022 Agricultural Census statistics are reported at the state
      level.  These NASS state-level boundary files were used in the production of
      the 2022 United States Census of Agriculture, Agricultural Census Web Maps.
      The boundary files can be employed in a desktop or online Geographic Information
      System (GIS) with the 2022 Agricultural Census statistical data by using the
      NASS Agricultural Census state codes to associate the state-level spatial entities
      with the NASS state-level statistical data.
    Purpose:
      The boundaries are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state
      level.  The boundary data are designed for small scale thematic mapping
      applications at a scale of 1:20,000,000 or smaller (e.g., 1:50,000,000, etc.).
      The state-level boundaries are provided "as is".  The USDA/NASS does not
      warrant the results you may obtain using the Agricultural Census state-level
      boundary data.
    Supplemental_Information:
      These NASS Agricultural Census state-level boundary files may be used with statistical
      data in the 2022 Census of Agriculture, Volume 1, Geographic Area Series, Parts 1 - 50.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Unmodified entities have entity codes and names which conform to
      the American National Standards Institute's INCITS 38–2009[R2014],
      formerly Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 5-2.
      Area values in square miles are derived from land polygon area
      values from the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER database.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: No topological checks were performed on the data.
  Completeness_Report:
    The generalized data do NOT include 1) boundaries for the Aleutian
    Islands in the Eastern Hemisphere, 2) boundaries for Hawaiian Islands
    west of -160.555771 degrees longitude, 3) very small polygons because of
    coordinate thinning, and 4) water polygons.  This data set provides the land
    area in square miles and number of acres for each state equivalent.  The land
    area values are based on the area of land polygons from the U.S. Census Bureau's
    TIGER database.  If a state is composed of several polygons, the area value
    assigned to each polygon is the land area value of the entire state (for the
    purpose of choropleth mapping).  The state-level boundary for Maryland was
    modified to include the District of Columbia (D.C.), because Agricultural Census
    data for D.C. are not reported separately.  State-level American National Standards
    Institute (ANSI) codes are used to identify states. Because Maryland and D.C. state
    boundaries were aggregated, Maryland's ANSI code 24 represents both Maryland (24)
    and D.C. (11).
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The state-level boundary data are highly generalized and suitable
        for use in small scale (1:20,000,000) thematic mapping applications.
        No accuracy tests were performed.

        1 - Creation of NASS Agricultural Census state-level boundary file.
        Use state boundary and attribute source files provided by the Bureau of the Census.
        State boundaries were aggregated (dissolved) on the NASS Agricultural Census state
        (ANSI) codes. State land area values were summed to produce state land area values
        in square miles (District of Columbia aggregated with Maryland).

        2 - Update of state-level boundary file.
        The 2022 Agricultural Census state boundary files were updated with 2022 attribute
        values. The state acreage fields were populated by multiplying the state land area
        in square miles by 640 (1 square mile = 640 acres).

        Dissolve the 2012 1:20,000,000 scale Agricultural Census state-level boundary file to
        create a coastline boundary file (more detailed than 2022 1:20,000,000 scale coastline).

        Projected 2012 1:20,000,000 US coastline boundary file and used it to clip the 2022
        1:20,000,000 scale NASS Agricultural Census state-level boundary file. Clipping the 2022
        state-level boundary file by the 2012 coastline adds more detail (e.g., coastal inlets)
        to the 2022 state-level boundary file.
