  Description:
    Abstract:
      The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural
      Statistics Service (NASS) conducted an Agricultural Census in 2022.  The
      statistical census data are summarized at the county, state, and U.S. levels
      and are available in a digital format.  The Research and Development Division
      of NASS modified generalized county boundaries to show geographic areas for
      which the 2022 Agricultural Census statistics are reported at the county
      level.  These NASS county-level boundary files were used in the production of
      the 2022 United States Census of Agriculture, Agricultural Census Web Maps.
      The boundary files can be employed in a desktop or online Geographic Information
      System (GIS) with the 2022 Agricultural Census statistical data by using the
      NASS Agricultural Census county codes to associate the NASS county-level spatial
      entities with the NASS county-level statistical data.
    Purpose:
      The boundaries are intended for geographic display and analysis at the county-
      level.  The boundary data are designed for small scale thematic mapping
      applications at a scale of 1:20,000,000 or smaller (e.g., 1:50,000,000, etc.).
      The county-level boundaries are provided "as is".  The USDA/NASS does not
      warrant the results you may obtain using the Agricultural Census county-level
      boundary data.
    Supplemental_Information:
      These NASS Agricultural Census county-level boundary files may be used with statistical
      data in the 2022 Census of Agriculture, Volume 1, Geographic Area Series, Parts 1 - 50.

    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Unmodified entities have entity codes and names which conform to
      the American National Standards Institute's INCITS 31–2009[R2014],
      formerly Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 6-4, and
      INCITS 38–2009[R2014], formerly Federal Information Processing Standard
      (FIPS) 5-2. Area values in square miles are derived from land polygon area
      values from the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER database.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: No topological checks were performed on the data.
  Completeness_Report:
    The generalized data do NOT include 1) boundaries for the Aleutian
    Islands in the Eastern Hemisphere, 2) boundaries for Hawaiian Islands
    west of -160.555771 degrees longitude, 3) very small polygons because of
    coordinate thinning, and 4) water polygons.  This data set provides the
    land area in square miles and in acres for each county equivalent (or
    agricultural census area in Alaska).  The land area values are based on
    the area of land polygons from the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER database.
    If a county is composed of several polygons, the area value assigned to
    each polygon is the land area value of the entire county (for the purpose
    of choropleth mapping).  Some of the county-level boundaries were modified
    to show geographic areas for which Agricultural Census statistics are
    reported.  County Federal Information Processing (FIPS) codes for the
    modified counties were replaced by Agricultural Census county codes.  States
    with modifications to their county boundaries and county codes are - Alaska,
    Hawaii, Maryland, Missouri, Virginia (and the District of Columbia).
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The county-level boundary data are highly generalized and suitable
        for use in small scale (1:20,000,000) thematic mapping applications.
        No accuracy tests were performed.

        1 - Creation of NASS Agricultural Census counties and summation of land area.
        Use county boundary and attribute source files provided by the Bureau of the Census.
        The county-level boundaries show geographic areas for which 2022 Agricultural Census
        statistics are reported.  Certain individual counties were assigned the ANSI code of
        a designated adjacent or surrounding county. County boundaries were dissolved on the
        NASS Agricultural Census county (ANSI) codes and county land area values (in square
        miles) were summed - this modified only the land area values for aggregated (dissolved)
        counties in AK, HI, MD, MO, VA.
        The following is a list of counties with modified boundaries.  The Agricultural
        Census county codes and associated (=) U.S. county ANSI codes are identified below.
